# Go Big or Go Home Split Keyboard

I want to have a split keyboard on my armrests, and my willingness+ability to make a custom keyboard is greater than my willingness/ability to retrain my typing/editing memory.

Most split keyboards tend toward more minimal key sets and layers for various functions. This one...is a bit more like we took a full size 100% keyboard and broke it in half and added stuff.

This repo is forked from [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) for the firmware with added/changed stuff.
